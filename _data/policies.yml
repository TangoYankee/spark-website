#  desc: 'Representatives from each major command in the US Air Force met March 5-7 at Travis Air Force Base, California, for an innovation summit focusing on the implementation of the Spark Innovation program at various bases across the Air Force. "The Spark Summit and the idea of base-level innovation is a reaction to the fact that we need to get smarter," said Col. Matthew Leard. "We can’t predict the threats we are going to face tomorrow, but one thing is certain:  To defeat our enemies and protect this country, we need a stronger and more agile and smarter military than ever before." said Vice President Mike Pence. For Leard,  Maj. Anthony Perez and the rest of Travis’ Phoenix Spark team, that stronger and smarter military starts at the grassroots. "Every base—every Airman has the capacity to come up with incredible solutions to problems facing the Air Force now or could face in the future. It’s up to us as officers, supervisors or even fellow Airmen to empower each other to make those strides and facilitate the processes that allow us to do so." said Perez'
