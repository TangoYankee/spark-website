  desc: 'Senior leaders from the 18th Air Force and Air Mobility Command joined aircrew members from the 21st Airlift Squadron at Travis Air Force Base, California, on a C-17 Globemaster III Aug. 12. They secured the implementation of the first ever Phoenix Spark initiative: A C-17 Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) Mount. "The Phoenix Spark program allows us to make innovative ideas, bring them up and influence them quicker into our community (rather) than driving them all the way up the chain, taking months to years at a time," said Captain Steven Noller. "We’re working together with our maintenance team here, and we’re working together with other wings... We’re trying to implement solutions at a faster rate," said Maj. Michael Price. "Our solution, at maximum, to outfit the entire fleet (every C-17 in the Air Force), was $40,000," said Captain Spencer Turek. "Addressing a solution through Phoenix Spark sped the process along considerably." said Tech. Sgt. Nathaniel Harris. "Through flying with us, he was able to see what we were struggling with and having to find workarounds for" said Maj. Dominik Niziol.'

  desc: Named for Travis’ own innovation initiative, the "Phoenix Spark Challenge" allowed 49 students from the local community the opportunity to flex their genius on a set of three challenges currently facing Travis engineers. "Providing these students the freedom and resources to pursue their own ideas and nurture their passions is what the Phoenix Spark Challenge is ultimately about." said Staff Sgt. Cory Carlisle. The challenges required a comprehensive knowledge of STEAM with all three involving problems that intersected into each subject’s principles. Along with being a way to get students engaged in STEAM topics, the competition’s use of real-world problems is useful in instilling a sense of civic responsibility, said Lisette Estrella-Henderson. Growing up as a military brat, Estrella-Henderson knows what education means to the military. "I understand the challenges that military families face as they seek quality educational opportunities for their children wherever they may be stationed..." It was the impetus of providing a better education to those military students that first drove her to want to support the competition, she said. For Carlisle, the idea of a regionalized approach to innovation is what the Phoenix Spark Challenge represents; the genesis of a movement he hopes to see implemented in communities Air Force-wide.

  desc: Professionals from across industry, academia and government met with representatives from Travis Air Force Base’s Phoenix Spark program here Aug. 1 as part of an effort to connect external experts with problem sets faced by today’s warfighter. "We are trying to connect you, the experts, with interesting problem sets that the warfighter has identified," said Maj. Tony Perez. "After this event, our goal is to go beyond discussing the problems; we want to partner with you and actively work on solutions." The overarching concept Perez stressed during the collaboration was posed to the group in the form of a question, "How do we bring tomorrow’s tools to the warfighter today?" The Phoenix Spark program and events like the Phoenix Collider are "the connective tissue" between Travis Airmen and experts who can realize solutions, said Perez.

  desc: Spark started as a group of motivated, and admittedly frustrated, individuals.  Frustrated with the small nuisances that plagued their day-to-day work life, and how seemingly simple solutions were right outside the gate but just out of reach.  Airmen felt frustrated because a simple change was always met with a 'no' or a 'yes, but insert long list of illogical barriers here.

  desc: 'Representatives from each major command in the US Air Force met March 5-7 at Travis Air Force Base, California, for an innovation summit focusing on the implementation of the Spark Innovation program at various bases across the Air Force. "The Spark Summit and the idea of base-level innovation is a reaction to the fact that we need to get smarter," said Col. Matthew Leard. "We can’t predict the threats we are going to face tomorrow, but one thing is certain:  To defeat our enemies and protect this country, we need a stronger and more agile and smarter military than ever before." said Vice President Mike Pence. For Leard,  Maj. Anthony Perez and the rest of Travis’ Phoenix Spark team, that stronger and smarter military starts at the grassroots. "Every base—every Airman has the capacity to come up with incredible solutions to problems facing the Air Force now or could face in the future. It’s up to us as officers, supervisors or even fellow Airmen to empower each other to make those strides and facilitate the processes that allow us to do so." said Perez'
